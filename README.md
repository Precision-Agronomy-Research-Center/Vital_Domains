# Vital_Domains
We built a taxonomy of vital domains that support human life, and which require active effort to maintain. We seek to curate appropriate technologies to enable humans to support themselves across these vital domains. We welcome translations, requests for revisions, additions, and redefinitions, and discussion on this and other topics
